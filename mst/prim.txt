using a priority queue and a vistied array i can get the minmum spanning tree 1)first what is a spanning tree? spanning tree is a graph(tree) forms of n nodes and n-1 edges that been taken from the orignal graph n nodes and m edges 2)second what is minimum spanning tree? it is the spanning tree with minmum summation of edges weight from all of the spanning tree 3)explain the algorithm? we start at any node of the given graph ,we carry in the pq the node and edge weight and parent if a node is not vistited and it's not the first node in the pq(parent!=-1) the mark it as visited and add the edge to MST then add all children if not visited
