what is a bridge ?
it's an edge if you remove this edge it increase overall componenets of the 
graph.

bridge can't be an edge in a cycle
-----------------------------------------------
Bridges algorithms 

- brute force approch 
try erase ith edge and check connectivity o(m * m)

- Tarjan algorithm
use dfs# and LowLink and you minmize the LowLink with all your children apart
from parent and after all minmization if LowLink[node] == dfn[node] then
it's a bridge between parent of this node and this node but consider the case
when the parent = -1 when start calling this function.
