can be applied on directed graph this algorithm get the number of the strongly connected component in a graph and print them sperate strongly connected component--->scc---> in a scc each pair in of nodes in component are reachable for each other steps of the algorithm 1)do a normal dfs on the graph at every node not visited and sort all edges according to the finishing time using stack 2)reverse the graph if there is an edge from u-->v make it from v-->u 3)iterate on the stack from top on the reversed graph if visited continue else all it can reach is a scc and procced until stack is empty
