you need to have access to the max element using stack so use 

stack of pairs the first element is the array element and the second 
is the max so far.

you initialize the stack with INT_MIN, INT_MIN and this considered as empty
stack.

when you are inserting you emplace(x,max(x,st.top().second)).

when you are deleting you are poping. st.pop();

when asscess the first element you return st.top().first

when size return st.size()-1

when max return st.top().second

when empty return st.size() == 1
