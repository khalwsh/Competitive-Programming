# Competitive Programming Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! This repository serves as a collection of templates, algorithms, and solutions for competitive programming contests (e.g., Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, codechef). The goal is to provide efficient, well-structured, and reusable code snippets to tackle common problems encountered in programming competitions. Whether you're preparing for contests or honing your problem-solving skills, this repo aims to save you time during coding rounds.

## What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming involves solving algorithmic and mathematical problems under time constraints, often with optimized code. Competitors write programs to solve problems that test their logical thinking, data structure knowledge, and algorithmic efficiency. This repository focuses on providing **ready-to-use templates** for frequently encountered patterns, along with implementations of advanced algorithms.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:
- **Templates**: Boilerplate code for common problems (e.g., segment trees, shortest paths).
- **Algorithms**: Efficient implementations of standard algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, KMP, Union-Find).
- **Solutions**: Example solutions for contest problems (linked in the Table of Contents).
- **Utilities**: Fast I/O methods, debugging macros, and language-specific optimizations.
