A trail which states ends at same vertex is called euler circuit.
what is a trail? A walk in which no edge is depulicated (nodes could depulicated)
what is a walk? any random traversal in graph (dfs,..)

euler path conditions?
1)start == end
2)every edge must be used only one.

Euler Graph: is a graph having Euler circuit in it and all edges in the graph must be in a single componenet,
All other components should have at most one vertex with no edges.

in Euler Graph all vertex have even degree

Euler Path: is a path that writes every edge exactly once. so euler circuit is a euler path that starts and end 
at the same vertex.

Semi-Eulerian-graph conditions?
1)every edge is enterd once
2)start vertex != end vertex  this mean exactly 2 vertices must have odd degree (start and end vertex)
3)all vertices with non-zero degree are connected.

ALGORITHM STEPS

1)connectivity check ==> check if all edges are present in only one component.
-- find a node with degree > 0. and do dfs mark nodes can reach
-- check all not visited nodes if at least one have degree > 0 then it's not euler graph.
2)count odd degree nodes (use adj list)
-- count == 0 ==> eulerian graph ---> euler cycle
-- count == 2 ==> semi-eulerian graph ---> euler path
-- count >= 3 ==> not eulerian graph

the difference between euler path and cycle? the path start at node and end at other node the cycle same node

in euler path ? every intermediate node should have even degree (start and end) are odd
in euler cycle? every node in the graph has even degree

if the graph was directed? 
euler cycle? indgree[i] == outdegree[i] for all nodes.
euler path? start node : indgree[i] == outdegree[i]-1 ,end node:indegree[i]=outdegree[i]+1,other in == out
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hierholzer's algorithm ( to get euler cycle)
-find cycles and combine them.
Steps:
--start from whatever node v get a cycle then iterate on the cycle elements if there is any node still have
edges go and get it's cycle and replcace the node with it's cycle.

Defenation:
Euler path:paths which use each edge only one.
Euler Circuit: path,that starts and ends at the same place ans uses each edge only once.
Hamiltonian path: path which visits each vertex only once.
Hamiltonian circuit: path,that starts and end on the same place and visit each vertex only once.
Exists:
Euler path:at most 2 nodes with odd vertices.
Euler circuit: all nodes have even degrees.
