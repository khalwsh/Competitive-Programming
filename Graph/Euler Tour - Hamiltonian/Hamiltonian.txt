Hamiltonian path: path which visits each vertex only once.
Hamiltonian circuit: path,that starts and end on the same place and visit each vertex only once.

-NP-Hard problem 

problem find all hamiltonian cycles in the graph.

- graph must me connected and one compoenet
- if there is any articulation point there is no hamiltonian 
- visit every node only once
