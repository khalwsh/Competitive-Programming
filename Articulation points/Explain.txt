what is an articulation point ?
if graph is fully connected it disconnect the graph.
if there is a bridge there exist an articulation point but not viceverse
---------------------------------------------
Algorithms

- DFS [brute force]
erase the node and check if the graph is disconnected.

- Tarjan
like normal but the condition for check if node is an art point is
      if(lowlink[val]>=dfn[node]) 
         Art[node] = true;
but you need to handle the root because in this case always it will be 
counted as art point so you handle this by count how many times the node
has unvisted childern in variable and if the node is the root and have 
children not visited more than one only in this case the root is art point

void Tarjan(int node,int parent){
    dfn[node] = LowLink[node] = ndfn++;
    int child = 0;
    for(auto &val:adj[node]){
        if(dfn[val]==-1){
            child++;
            Tarjan(val,node);
            LowLink[node] = min(LowLink[node],LowLink[val]);
            if(LowLink[val]>=dfn[node]){
                if(parent==-1&&child<=1)continue;
                IsArtPoints[node] = true;
            }
        }else if(parent!=val){
            LowLink[node] = min(LowLink[node],dfn[val]);
        }
    }
}

what is biconnected graph?
A graph with no art points. and is connected graph 

Biconnected componenets(BBC): if graph has articulation points,split graph 
to components from these points each component is called a biconnected comp

A graph with N art points has N+1 biconnected components.
