every query have 3 items:
- query start 
- query end
- query time --> index in input


we will change how to sort:

previous ---> small block first in case of tie smallest EndBlock first

now ---> small block size first then smallest EndBlock then smallest time



you have two arrays one for queries that contain [ST,EN,TIME]
TIME: number of updates happen before you.

the second array is the updates queries each have [prev,updated] values



-how algorithm work?
you have instead of 4 while loops to adjust the range of query you gonna
have 6 while 2 for time ,2 for start , 2 for end.
the Time Whiles if inserting --> change prev to new else reverse.
