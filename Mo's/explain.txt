order the queries in a way that you minmize the total moving.
ex:

1 4
8 10
5 7

the best order is:

1 4
5 7
8 10

how to efficently sort?

we sort based on the group with the start of the range then with in the group 
we sort based on the end of the range

why it is fast?
with in each group starting ranges have at max distance equal to sqrt.
and the end of ranges have in total distance n so complexity is o(n*sqrt(n))
