                                ================== probablilty ==================

the probablility of an event to ocur is calculated by
dividing the number of this even by the total events

P(E)=|E|/|S|;

the conditional probablility: P(A|B)=P(intersect of A and B)/P(B)

P(intersect of A and B) = P(B)*P(A|B) and if B and A is independant so P(A|B) is P(A)

what is the probablity that all event happens at same time?
P(E1,E2,E3,....,En) = P(E1)*P(E2)*P(E3)...*P(En)

the excpected value : summation of profit * P(event) over all possible outcomes.

question:

assume you are in class and you are the teacher what is the probablilty of 2 of your students
their birthday in this day?

assuming that there is a 365 day in year

answer:

first let us view the problem with backward thinking so instead we calculate that the probablilty of 2 of your students their birthday in this day we calculate the probablilty of that no 2 students have birthday in same day
so ans = 1 - P( no 2 students have birthday in same day )

p( no 2 students have birthday in same day )= nPr(365,30)/fastPower(365,30).


question:

what is the probablilty of getting k heads in n flips of coin?

assume that every coin has two state heads or tails and P(heads) = .5 and P(tails) = .5

answer:
A---> having k heads
P(A)= how many time A happen/ total space

total space = fast_power(2,n)

how many time A happen = nCr(n,k) 

result = nCr(n,k)/fast_power(2,n)

question:

you have n children every one of them will take a random number from 1 to k candies what is the max excpected value a child could get?

answer:
we can use dp to brute force if n * k <= 1e8
else
we can use formula E(V) = summation of X*P(X)

assume x is the max candies child can get so what is the probability that at least one child have i candies 
and i<=x it is (i/k)^n so what is the probability that i==x it is the probability of at least one child have
less than or equal to x candies - the probability of at least one child have less than or equal to x-1 candies

so P(X) = (X/k)^n-((X-1)/k)^n
and answer is summation of x from 1 to k

what about if their is another exmaple that have a uniform distrubation not discret distrubation 
like there is n children are filling bottle of water so the amount of water could be any value [0,k]
including fractions
the excepted max is equal k*(n)/(n+1)
the excepted min is equal k*(1)/(n+1)


what is the expected value of having N heads by tossing coin?

E(N heads) = E(head) * N, E(head)-->is two so E(N heads)-->2*N.
===============================================================================================================
contribution to the sum technique:

if we want to find teh sum over many ways possiblities, we should consider every element and count how many times it will be added to the answer.

ex1: count how many such i<j<k a[i]<a[j]>a[k]?
that can solved just by caring for j and count how many left and how many bigger on right then this contribute
to the answer with smaller_left[j]*bigger_right[j].

ex2: get the summation of all paths in a rooted tree
we can for every edge get the cost of paths that contain it so we can make an array dp that dp[i]-> is the number of nodes in the subtree of (i) then every node contribute to the answer by dp[i]*(n-dp[i]) but the root
doesn't contribute to anything.

ex3: given a sequence find the expected value of the difference between max and min over all 2^N -1 possiblites
this could be solve using contribution to the sum by make two loops consider every pair of numbers then 
calculating there contribution to answer as (max(pair)-min(pair))*2^count of (value >= mn &&value<=mx).
consider seq: 2 , 1, 7, 5, 3 , 4
the pair(2,7) contribute to the answer by (7-2)*2^3. then do this for every pair and finally divide by (2^N-1).

this could be solved in only o(nlog(n)) by linearity E(max-min)=E(max)-E(min) sort numbers then solution is
E(max)=(2^(index+1)-1)*value/(2^N-1).
E(min)=(2^(size-(index+1))-1)*value/(2^N-1).
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Expected value: 
 
E(x) = value(x) * P(x) ,  P(x) = number of events x exist / space
E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)
E(X*Y) = E(X) * E(Y)
