square root decomposition: 

Given a segment of n elements and you are asked for qureies and you can't handle it with range datastructure like segment tree so you partiation the 
array to fixed size blocks and precompute their answer then when quering
you consider the not compleleted part of the begining and end and for every
complete part within range you use the precomputed answer.


array : 1 2 3 1 13 123 32 1 31 11 12 17
block size = 2 , query: 1 11

your soltuions is: from 1 to 2 use the brute force and from 11 to 11 and
for the rest of the range 3,4,...,10
you use the precomputed answer for every block {3,4} , {5,6} , {7,8} , {9,10}

time complexity : O(N/blocksize + blocksize) so you choose the block size in
order to minmize this equation.

---------------------------------------------------------
important techinque:

if there is a problem that require precomputation and have updates and there
is no way to mantain updates and the structure in the same time then you can
build the structure and have the updates alone in vector and while answering 
the quries use the structure and use the vector and whenever the vector size
is sqrt(n) rebuild the structure with new line added and clear the vector.

---------------------------------------------------------
important fact:

if you have n elements that there summation is S then there is at most sqrt(s) disticnt values.
